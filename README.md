This repository is a temporary home for code to generate "validation" text files
for the IANA-hosted time zone data.

For background, see http://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz/2015-July/022349.html

If the approach proves successful, more discussion around the file format,
appropriate generation tools etc will be required. Initially, all code within
this repository should be seen as highly experimental, and likely to be hacked
together with little thought to longevity.
